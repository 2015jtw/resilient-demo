      "Dr. Schaller previously held executive roles in a national financial services firm for nearly two decades, during which time he experienced several significant crises. These events served as motivation to explore crisis management and the dynamics between the public and private sectors amid a disaster. Following his executive roles, Dr. Schaller entered public service as a first responder, which provided a diverse perspective of the 'ground truth' of disasters.",
      "In this latter role, his leadership focused on developing integrated emergency management practices between public agencies and the private sector. His subsequent doctoral research centered on boards and senior executive crisis decision-making within the context of the COVID pandemic. Based on the interviews of 35 directors and executives, this research illuminated the dynamics of decision-making under extreme uncertainty and insights for leaders in navigating future crises.",
