      "Dr. Schaller previously held executive roles in a national financial services firm for nearly two decades, during which time he experienced several significant crises. These events served as motivation to explore crisis management and the dynamics between the public and private sectors amid a disaster. Following his executive roles, Dr. Schaller entered public service as a first responder, which provided a diverse perspective of the “ground truth” of disasters.",
      "In this latter role, his leadership focused on developing integrated emergency management practices between public agencies and the private sector. His subsequent doctoral research centered on boards and senior executive crisis decision-making within the context of the COVID pandemic. Based on the interviews of 35 directors and executives, this research illuminated the dynamics of decision-making under extreme uncertainty and insights for leaders in navigating future crises.",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic was a wake-up call to leadership that preparedness matters. While the impacts of the pandemic were largely out of our control, there were a number of internal practices that may have limited the consequences. Our research suggests that the previous crisis had a significant influence on firms in preparing for future disruptions. ",
      "Resilient, LLC maintains a network of subject matter experts across a wide spectrum of domains related to crises. We strive to provide appropriate recommendations for the resources that may be required in better preparing your organization, regardless of the current environment, whether that be blue skies or in the midst of a hurricane. We invite you to explore this site to gain our perspectives on the crisis leadership landscape and how we might guide you through the improvement process.",
